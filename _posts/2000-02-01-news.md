## BlissFlixx Version 3 Released  (June 2022)

It looks pretty much the same as previous versions. But it has **a lot** of changes under the hood bringing the BlissFlixx experience to modern times. 

BlissFlixx now uses python 3 and drops support for python 2.

The only supported OS for now is: Raspberry PI OS 10 (Buster) 32 bits - desktop and lite. No X required.

If you **really need** Raspberry PI OS 11 (Bullseye):
 - start by installing Buster 
 - run `configure.sh`
 - do a `distupgrade` to bullseye 
 - run the `configure.sh` script again

This way OmxPlayer gets installed in Buster but remains when updating to Bullseye. 

### Future Plans

Since Bullseye stopped using OmxPlayer as it's default video player. The next release will focus on using VLC allowing BlissFlixx to support 64 bit architectures and other OSs like Ubuntu and Armbian. Even other Single Board Computers!
