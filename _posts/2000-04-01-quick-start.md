## Prepare

Before starting you should have the following:

 - Raspberry Pi with an SD card larger than 8Gb running Raspberry PI OS 10 (Buster)
 - Good Internet connection
 - Any screen plugged into the Raspberry Pi
 - Any device with a web browser for controlling BlissFlixx

## Install

From a command prompt:

    git clone https://github.com/blissland/blissflixx.git
    cd blissflixx
    sudo ./configure.sh -boot -blank

Wait for half an hour until the script finishes and reboot. BlissFlixx will start at boot and blank the screen automatically.

## Enjoy

Point your web browser to your raspberry pi:
